# Positive+1 Flutter Developer Technology Test

## Introduction
Thank you for participating in the Positive+1 technology test for Flutter developers. This test is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your proficiency in Flutter UI development, API creation, backend integration, and testing practices.

## Objective
Your task is to replicate the functionality and UI of a provided design mockup for a social network support group application targeted at individuals with HIV. Your challenge is to build an API that your Flutter app will consume to present a list of posts.

## Designs!

## Test Instructions

### Step 1: API Development
Develop an API that returns a list of posts. You can use any backend technology of your choice (e.g., Node.js, Python with Flask or Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.).

### Step 2: Flutter Application
Create a Flutter application that:
- Fetches and displays the posts from your API.
- Matches the provided UI design mockup as closely as possible.

### Step 3: (Optional) Testing
Write tests for both your API and Flutter application:
- Include unit tests for your backend.
- Include widget tests for your Flutter app.

### Step 4: (Optional) Documentation
Provide a README.md file with:
- Instructions on how to set up and run your API and Flutter app.
- A brief explanation of your technical choices, including architecture and third-party libraries used.

## Submission Guidelines
- Fork this repository.
- Complete your project within your fork, in a new directory named after yourself (e.g., `john-doe/`).
- Place all your code and a README.md file with setup instructions in this directory.
- Create a pull request to the original repository targeting the `main` branch for review.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- **Functionality**: Does the application function as required?
- **UI Accuracy**: Does the UI closely match the provided design mockup?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are there meaningful tests? Do they cover critical functionalities of the app?
- **Documentation**: Is the project and codebase adequately documented to understand your design choices and how to run the code?

## Final Notes
- Prioritize quality over quantity. It's better to submit a project that does one thing well than a project that does many things poorly.
- If you have any questions, please open an issue in this repository.

Good luck with your test, we are excited to see your innovative solutions!
